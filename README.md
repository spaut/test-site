## Our Story

San Francisco, CA, January 3, 2017 -- Scott Dadich, editor in chief of WIRED for the past four years, today announced the formation of Godfrey Dadich Partners (GDP) a strategy, design, and content firm based in San Francisco. Under co-CEOs Dadich and Patrick Godfrey, GDP will help clients define organizational strategy, create impactful experiences, and develop content to drive immersive, action-oriented engagement. Godfrey Dadich Partners offers clients two great talents – one a master of re-imagining businesses and propelling them forward, the other a master storyteller who can craft highly engaging experiences across multiple platforms – in a single partnership.

Dadich spent 11 years at Condé Nast, serving as WIRED’s Creative Director as well as Editor in Chief. Under his leadership, WIRED earned 10 Webby Awards, more than 50 Society of Publication Designers medals, and four National Magazine Awards for design. Dadich oversaw the redesign of nearly every aspect of the brand, from the magazine and website to the organizational structure and even its San Francisco headquarters. He tripled WIRED’s reach on social media, increased traffic to WIRED.com by 50%, and pushed page views past one billion a year. Dadich also co-founded WIRED Brand Lab, an entirely new business model for WIRED and Condé Nast as a full-service agency.
